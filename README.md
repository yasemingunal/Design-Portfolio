Dashboard and Watch for Runners:
The purpose of the system is to provide asthma sufferers who partake in running regularly with real-time and predictive management techniques. The system will leverage data that such users already collect (personal informatics data and asthma symptom or medication data), to reduce the  cognitive load required from manual tracking. The system will combine wearable technology (such as a fitness watch) with a mobile/web dashboard to monitor asthma symptoms, understand how it impacts usersâ€™ running and exercise, and offer recommendations for safe and effective training. Overall, this tool will provide management methods for users and simultaneously optimize their physical health and running performance. 

IXL Redesigns:
A personal project to provide Figma mockups of a potential new feature (homework assignments) and reduce information overload as well as search times through collapsible menus

Design Samples:
A portfolio project for my MSc. in Human-Computer Interaction at UCL showcasing different product development methods and user evaluation techniques.
